    "bio": "I love watching travel or food related videos youtube, eating at new restaurants, and hiking upstate. Not really a sports guy, but I did take an interest in badminton and bowling in high school. Before making my transition into tech, I was an assistant General Manager at Chipotle. I was able to see the progression of their app from their launch day from a user standpoint. It bothered me that if people wanted a quesadilla, they didn't have a button for it, which caused a huge inconvenience for everyone. That triggered my interest in app development.",
