    "bio": "I love watching travel or food related videos on youtube, eating at new restaurants, and hiking upstate. Fun fact: I took interest in badminton and bowling in high school. Before making my transition into tech, I was an assistant General Manager at Chipotle. I was able to see the progression of their app from their launch day. I observed all the flaws of the app from both the customers and workers view. It bothered me that if people wanted a quesadilla, they didn't have a button for it, which caused a huge inconvenience for everyone (still to this day, try it). That triggered my interest in app development.",
